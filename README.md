#### Getting started
1. Install gulp globally: `npm install -g gulp`
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `gulp`
4. A browser window should open for you with livereload enabled. File changes will automatically trigger a page reload. CSS changes can be instantly injected without page reload.
